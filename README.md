# Battleships! ðŸš¢
## Battleship program developed in python3 for SE320 @ Chapman University.
### Your typical game of battle boats/battleships that is playable through a terminal. 
#### Setup & Rules: 
    1. 10x10 grid will have 8 ships of variable length randomly placed about
    2. You will have 50 bullets to take down the ships that are placed down
    3. You can choose a row and column such as A3 to indicate where to shoot
    4. For every shot that hits or misses it will show up in the grid
    5. A ship cannot be placed diagonally, so if a shot hits the rest of
        the ship is in one of 4 directions, left, right, up, and down
    6. If all ships are unearthed before using up all bullets, you win else, you lose

#### Key:
    1. "." = water
    2. "O" = part of ship
    3. "X" = part of ship that was hit
    4. "#" = water that was shot with bullet, a miss because it hit no ship

#### How to run:    
To run the program locate the program in your directory on your device and use the command "python3 battleship.py" (may differ depending on the version of python that you have installed)
